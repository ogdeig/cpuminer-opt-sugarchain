./cpuminer --cputest
```

# Run
All address format (legacy, p2sh-segwit and ___bech32___) supported.

 * Mining Pool - `-t1` using 1 thread.
```
./cpuminer -a yespower -o stratum+tcp://1pool-testnet.cryptozeny.com:3333 -u sugar1qnd3mamq6e7wsrml40ve95h3y3l9u9sq7gj0fc0 -t1
```

 * Solo - `44229` is testnet. `-u` and `-p` is on the coind. (adding `--no-longpoll` for displaying correct net_diff)
```
./cpuminer -a yespower -o http://localhost:44229 --no-longpoll -u rpcuser -p rpcpassword --coinbase-addr=sugar1qnd3mamq6e7wsrml40ve95h3y3l9u9sq7gj0fc0 -t1

# README

cpuminer-opt is a fork of cpuminer-multi by TPruvot with optimizations
imported from other miners developped by lucas Jones, djm34, Wolf0, pooler,
Jeff garzik, ig0tik3d, elmad, palmd, and Optiminer, with additional
optimizations by Jay D Dee.

All of the code is believed to be open and free. If anyone has a
claim to any of the code, please post your case in the cpuminer-opt Bitcoin Talk forum
or by email.

Miner programs are often flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
a false positive, they are flagged simply because they are cryptocurrency
miners. The source code is open for anyone to inspect. If you don't trust
the software, don't use it.

See file RELEASE_NOTES for change log and compile instructions.

Requirements
------------

1. A x64 bit (x86_64) CPU with a minimum of SSE2 support. This includes
Intel Core2 and newer, and AMD equivalents. In order to take advantage of AES_NI
optimizations, a CPU with AES_NI is required. This includes Intel Westbridge
and newer, and AMD equivalents. Further optimizations are available on some
algoritms for CPUs with AVX and AVX2, Sandybridge and Haswell respectively.

Older CPUs are supported by cpuminer-multi by TPruvot but at reduced
performance.

ARM CPUs are not supported.

2. 64 bit Linux OS: Ubuntu and Fedora based distributions, including Mint and
Centos, are known to work and have all dependencies in their repositories.
Others may work but may require more effort. Older versions such as Centos 6
don't work due to missing features.
64 bit Windows OS is supported with mingw_w64 and msys or pre-built binaries.

MacOS, OSx and Android are not supported.

3. Stratum pool: Some algos may work with wallet mining using getwork or GBT. YMMV.

Errata
------

- Neoscrypt crashes on Windows, please use legacy version.

- AMD CPUs older than Piledriver, including Athlon x2 and Phenom II x4, are not
supported by cpuminer-opt due to an incompatible implementation of SSE2 on
these CPUs. Some algos may crash the miner with an invalid instruction.
Users are recommended to use an unoptimized miner such as cpuminer-multi.

- cpuminer-opt does not work when mining with Decred algo at Nicehash and produces
only "invalid extranonce2 size" rejects.

- Benchmark testing does not work for x11evo.

Bugs
----

Users are encouraged to post their bug reports on the Bitcoin Talk
forum at:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1326803.0

All bug reports must be accompanied by a proper definition.
This should include how the problem occurred, the command line
output from the miner showing at startup and any errors.
